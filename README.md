# Shortest-Path-using-BFS-DFS
I implemented BFS for finding shortest path in a graph and implemented DFS for Maze implementation .I have used Tkinter for proper visualization of working of both algorithms . It is very useful for students to understand working of BFS DFS and a real world Application.
